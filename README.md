# Another3dPrinterShroud
A 3d printer shroud for Ender 3

There are already lots of 3d printer shrouds out there.
So, I figured that I'd give myself an arbritrary goal for my design to make it stand out a bit. 
What I went with is a shroud which allows for the hotend to be detached without dismounting any other part.

To do this, I attempted lower the design's height to the level where I would have a clear view of the mounting screws.
